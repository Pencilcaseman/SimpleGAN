# SimpleGAN

A simple project trying to create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from first principles. That means no use of powerful libraries or prewritten code. Everything is written from scratch...


### THIS DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS AS A BASIS FOR YOUR OWN GAN UNTIL IT DOES!
